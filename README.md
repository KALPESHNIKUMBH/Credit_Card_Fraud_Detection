# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
## **Problem Statement:** 
* For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.
* In the banking industry, credit card fraud detection using machine learning and deep learning is not only a trend but a necessity for them to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning is helping these institutions to reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees as well as denials of legitimate transactions.
* In this project we will detect fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of Machine learning and deep learnig models.
* We will analyse customer-level data that has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group.
